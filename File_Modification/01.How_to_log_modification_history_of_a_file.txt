# How to log the modification history of a file.

In our day to day tasks we'll be working with so many files/directories.

face some difficulties like someone might remove a file accidentally or
due to some other cause. We may or may not have the backup plans but we
need to be sure to know who has done that and why.

For that we have a choice which is we can use the user's history to know
that. We do know that every user's command history will be logged. That
history will be saved in .bash_history file. Which can also be viewed by
using the history command by that specific user.

If the admin need to do audit to check the file modification history then
the .bash_history file can be used.
